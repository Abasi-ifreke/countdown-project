# countdown-project
The purpose of this project is to document my growth as I continue to learn python as a programming language.

## How the code works
Its a simple, easy to usee project.
All that is required of the user is to input goal and deadline, and the code will return the number of hours and days left to complete the set goal.
The format to giving values to the program is "goal:01.01.2022"
